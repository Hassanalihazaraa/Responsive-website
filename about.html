            <p>That is a good question!
                BeCode was founded by a group of people, organizations and associations with a passion for technology,
                convinced that everyone can learn to program with the right motivation.</p>
            <p>

                and that it is suitable for everyone.</p>

                <p>Soft Skills
                    Today employers are looking for plant leaders who are able to solve problems in an intelligent and
                    creative way. That is why at BeCode we mainly teach you to learn, to work in a team, and to manage a
                    project well from A to Z.

                    Tech Skills
                    At BeCode you will discover all aspects of building a website or mobile application. The training
                    covers
                    both “Front-End” and “Back-End” development. The Front-End, that is where the elements are built
                    that
                    you see on the screen and that you can interact with. The Back-End is the internal structure of the
                    website or app.</p>
